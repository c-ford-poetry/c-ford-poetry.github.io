#### Leaflet Map

Here is a link to a [leaflet map](assets/) of hospital catchment areas!

#### Methods and Models

Click here to download the QGIS model that cleans up the hospital data: [HospitalPreprocessing](/models/HospitalPreprocessing.model3).

And here is the gravity model of spatial interaction, [DistanceMatrixCatchmentAreas](/models/CatchmentAreas_v1_3.model3).

*Here are images of the model workflows, showing the various inputs and intermediate steps involved:*
