Hello, I'm Vincent Falardeau, a senior from Maine studying Geography at Middlebury College. This website contains an unedited portfolio of my work from course [GEOG 0323](https://gis4dev.github.io), offered in Spring 2021. Find that portfolio [here](opensource.html).

A more selective portfolio of some of my favorite projects from my time at Middlebury College can be found [here](portfolio.html).
