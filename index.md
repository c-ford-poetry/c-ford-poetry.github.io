Hello, I'm Vincent, a junior studying Geography at Middlebury College. This website should eventually contain a portfolio of my work from [GEOG 0323](https://gis4dev.github.io).

###### Projects
 - [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)

###### As yet, this website contains no content. In the meantime, allow me to recommend: 

 * strawberry almond-milk yogurt from the dining halls (when they open),
 * chocolate-chip pancakes,
 * and peanut butter & brown sugar sandwiches.
