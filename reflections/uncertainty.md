title: Error and Uncertainty
---

===

&emsp; One of the interesting points raised by Longley et al. in their chapter on error and uncertainty in GIS is the idea that uncertainty can accrue with the conceptualization, measurement, and analysis of real-world phenomena.  This might seem obvious, but there sometimes seems to be a tendency towards ignoring uncertainty, like scientific ostriches with their heads in the sand!  Even when a GIS analysis uses natural units, the conceptualization of those units can result in generalization and uncertainty. For instance, take the example of a field study of trees in a small forest. A geographer can mark the location of each tree, and can record the important attributes (species, height, diameter…), but no matter how much data they collect and record, that data remains a generalization of the complex living organism.  

&emsp; The potential for uncertainty, vagueness, and ambiguity only becomes more apparent when we are no longer working with what Longley et al. call natural units.  Maybe we are trying to define patches of deciduous and coniferous forest from the field data on trees – the definitions of ‘deciduous’ and ‘coniferous’ are *vague* (what statistical threshold qualifies a forest as one or the other?) and *ambiguous* (since the concepts are tied up in personal language, perception, values, etc).
