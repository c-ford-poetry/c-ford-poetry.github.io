title: What is Open Source GIScience?

In a prescient 2009 meta-analysis of trends in open source GIS and academic institutions, Sergio Rey describes the social nature of open source, addresses the potential benefits and challenges of merging open source and academic interests, and discusses some of the pros and cons of open source software relative to proprietary tools. To begin with a general definition of open source GIS, it might be described as the collaborative, social, and uninhibited development of ‘free software’ for use in the context of spatial analysis. In this context, free software is distinct from freeware, which is free but not completely modifiable or open. Additionally, there is a shade of difference between free software and open source – Rey describes open source as a rebrand meant to sidestep possible connotations of low quality in the word ‘free.’ Rey notes that the ‘free software’ movement today retains a greater philosophical commitment to its core freedoms and moral principles, while the open source philosophy is focused more on the practical applications. Sometimes the difference comes down to matters of copyright and licensing.

In Rey’s vision, there is something idealistic about open source work, and the way it abolishes hierarchies in favor of an anonymous meritocracy of participation. However, that idealistic strain runs up against tension. Firstly, there is the steepness of the learning curve for beginners, which can make the community somewhat exclusive. Then there is a sense of competition with private companies that might fork code into independent projects. Private companies also tend to employ open source developers, and while this is certainly not always positive or negative, we might imagine that this allows companies to maintain some representation of their interests in open source endeavors. This could also imaginably begin to separate the ‘haves’ from the ‘have-nots’ within the open source community, as some will have more financial freedom to pursue their projects. It is also unclear whether the idealized anonymity of the open source community obscures the same patterns of inequality (whether based on race, class, sex, age, etc.) as are found in academia and the private sector.

With regard to the integration of open source in academia, the benefits and opportunities are manifold; notably, researchers can implement novel methodologies through the customization of code and software, and students can download software to personal devices, allowing for greater personal ownership of their education. Rey writes that academic structures that value peer-reviewed articles over code contributions pose a major obstacle to wider adoption of open source principles in academia at large.
