### Remote Sensing Research

##### Temporal Methods in Woodlot Detection
As research assistants working with Professor Kimambo, Brooke Laird and I developed this poster representing our efforts to compare different temporal methods for mapping woodlots from Landsat and Sentinel imagery. We presented at the Spring Symposium in 2021, in a forum with many poster presenters from other departments and fields of study. Essentially, we found that classifying a stack of monthly Tasseled Cap Wetness images out-performed two other algorithms used in temporal classification, LandTrendr and CCDC.

##### Maine Watersheds
In January 2021, I designed this series of maps addressing conservation potential in midcoast Maine, focusing on wetlands and waterfowl habitat in the Medomak Pond watershed and in the town of Appleton. The goal was to assess how well conservation easements in the area align with wetlands, and where there could be more specific protection.
