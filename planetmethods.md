Here are some Google Earth Engine scripts with examples of how you can use high-resolution PlanetLabs imagery in your remote sensing project. The first section deals with using NICFI basemaps across a large study region for a simple landcover classification. The second series of scripts is focused on a local analysis in Mwatasi village, Tanzania. Here, multiple years of imagery are used to look at possible change over time, and the local focus allows for greater precision in the classified map.
